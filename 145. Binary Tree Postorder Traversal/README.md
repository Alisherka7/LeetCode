# 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```
### Example 2:
````
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```
 

### Constraints:
```
The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
```
